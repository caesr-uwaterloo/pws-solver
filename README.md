# Split Point Solver

## Extract CFG from Benchmark

One way to generate inputs for the solver is by using the script `src/extract.py`.
The usage is as follows:

```
src/extract.py -i <input>
```

The input to this script consists of two files.

- `<input>.s` : This is the GCN assembly code generated by HIP. It contains all basic block annotations and instructions executed by the kernel(s).
- `<input>.log` : This is the output generated by gem5 when running the HIP benchmark using the `WavefrontSplit` and `IPT` debug flags. It contains the address for each instruction and the execution time between instrumentation points, which we extract to determine basic block execution times.

The output of the script is a file that encodes the CFG in the following adjacency list format:

```
<source node> <execution time> <desination node 1> <desination node 2> ...
```

## Run Solver

The script `src/main.py` contains an invocation of the dynamic programming algorithm solver for a sample input graph.
The usage is as follows:

```
src/main.py
```
